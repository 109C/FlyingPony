# What is FlyingPony?

 A ultramodern JSON Minecraft server written in ES9 with the HTML8 boilerplate and cutting edge jQuery enabled node.js ModernizrifyJS.
 Because of the new ES9 quantum JIT emitters, it's guaranteed 110% uptime, even when restarting. (As long as you don't observe it.)
 
# I don't have ES9 yet, can I still use this?

 Yes you can! Using the babel-coffeJSr-ify runtime decompiler, it's possible to run this using only as ES 0.2 (Beta) jQuery engine.
 In fact, it even works on Netscape 1.33.7, using PWACFJSv9001. (PollyWantACrackerFiller.JS)

# No really, what is this?
 A spoof of flying-squid.
 
# This actually works?
 Surprisingly, you can log in and do some stuff, despite all the bugs...
